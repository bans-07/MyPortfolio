        <p className="mt-2">I am an experienced Quality Assurance Tester with a strong eye for detail and a passion for delivering high-quality software. 
          Over time, through hands-on practice and attending a coding bootcamp, I have expanded my skill set to become a Full-Stack Developer. 
          I have gained expertise in front-end and back-end development, as well as working with databases, allowing me to build and maintain complete web applications.</p>
          
          <p/>With a strong foundation in both testing and development, I bring a unique perspective to software engineering, ensuring not only functionality but also efficiency and user experience.
          I am eager to continue growing in this field and applying my skills to build innovative and reliable applications.
